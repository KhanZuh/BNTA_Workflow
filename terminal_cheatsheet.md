|`cd`|**c**hange **d**irectory (used to navigate our way around to a different direcotry)

## Manipulating files
To move a file we use the `mv` command - which requires information (such as the thing we're moving and the place we are moving it to).

> mv my_picture.png ..

The `..` shortcut means "the directory above this one". A single dot (`.`) means "this directory.
